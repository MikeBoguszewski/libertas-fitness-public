# Fitness Website - Built with Astro.js

## Overview

This is a fitness website I created to experiment with **Astro.js** for my portfolio. The website was built using a pre-made template to help accelerate the development process while I focused on learning how to integrate Astro.js, design some elements using **Figma**, and deploy it to a **real custom domain** using **Vercel**.

## Features

- Responsive design, optimized for mobile and desktop users.
- Static site generation for fast, optimized performance.
- Clean and user-friendly interface with a focus on fitness-related content.
- Logo and some design elements created with **Figma**.
- Template-based structure for easy modifications and scalability.
- Deployed on a **real custom domain** using **Vercel**, showcasing the site on a live URL.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Navigating Templates**
   - I explored how to select and work with pre-made templates, customizing them for my specific needs.
   - Understanding how templates are structured helped me quickly grasp how Astro.js functions, such as components, pages, and layouts.
   - I learned how to incorporate custom elements and tweak styles to match my vision while maintaining the core functionality of the template.

### 2. **Deploying with Vercel**
   - One of the biggest learning points was deploying the site to a **real custom domain** using **Vercel**.
   - I gained hands-on experience with the Vercel platform, from connecting my GitHub repository to setting up domain configurations.
   - Vercel made it easy to deploy and manage updates, which streamlined the process of pushing my site live.

### 3. **Designing with Figma**
   - I used **Figma** to design the logo and some other key visual elements of the site.
   - This helped me understand how to translate design concepts into real, functioning web elements while maintaining consistency and style.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro.js**: A modern framework for building fast, optimized websites with static site generation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building the frontend.
- **Figma**: Used for designing logos and other visual elements.
- **Vercel**: Hosting platform for seamless deployment.
- **Custom Domain**: Purchased and configured for this project to showcase the site on a live URL.

## Repository Access

The code is **private** as I may potentially use the project for **commercial or proprietary purposes** in the future. I want to retain control over the usage and distribution of the code for now.

## Final Thoughts

This project was an excellent opportunity to dive into Astro.js and explore modern front-end frameworks while practicing deployment on a live platform. The template helped me speed up the process, but I also learned valuable lessons about customization and integration. Deploying on a **real custom domain** using **Vercel** gave me practical knowledge of cloud deployment and hosting.
